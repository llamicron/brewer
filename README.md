# Brewer
A attempt at controlling a homemade homebrewing rig, at home.

See [adaptiman/adaptibrew](http://github.com/adaptiman/adaptibrew) for more details.

## Installation
Note: You probably don't want to install this. For anything to work, you need quite a bit of hardware. If you have the hardware set up correctly, then you already know what you're doing. Otherwise:

```
  $ pip install brewer
```

Or build from source:

```
  $ git clone http://github.com/llamicron/brewer.git
  $ cd brewer
  $ make build
  $ pip install dist/brewer-[VERSION-NUMBER].tar.gz
```

## Docs
Documentation generated by PDoc. See the docs at https://llamicron.github.io/brewer/

## Usage
Warning: You should probably be using [weber](http://github.com/llamicron/weber/). It does the same thing as this, but it's a web interface instead of a command line one.

After installation with pip (see above), run `python` from a command line and import the module.
```
>> from brewer.controller import Controller
>> con = Controller()
>> con.hlt(1) # Open HLT valve
>> con.hlt(0) # Close HLT valve
>> ...
```
If you don't have the proper hardware connected, `Controller()` will return a `FakeController` class. You can use this normally and it will simulate the hardware.
